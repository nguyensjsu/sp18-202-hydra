# Week 4-5 (ending 05/04/2017):
In this two week, I explore the different design patterns and implement the sound on and off module. I also work on diagram and documentations

# Courage (XP core value)

Bhushan and I meet regularly and are open about our progress on our work. Sometime we are behind schedule, but we do not make excuse, instead set goals and adapt changes. And by the end of May 4th, we successfully achieve all our goals and tasks.

# Week 3 (ending 04/21/2017):
This week, I study the structure of the based code. I come up with ideas of features that I want to add on. I decided to implement a sound on and off feature. 

Next week, I am going to explore different design patterns and implement the feature.

# Courage (XP core value)

It is very important to talk with the teammates and to be honest about our progress. With honest information, we can make a better plan and adjust our work accurately. 

# Week 2 (ending 04/14/2017):
  
In this week, I explored and  decided the game from greenfoot.

Next week, I plan to draw the class diagrams of the existing codes, and think about the features and design patterns that I may want to the original codes.

# Courage (XP core value)

In order to get our feet wet and start adding feature, our team needs to decide on the game we work on. Our main focues this week is to decide our start point. We exchange the examples we explore for the games developed in greenfoot and picked the one that we both are interested in. The communication is crucial and our researches serves as feedbacks.   

# Week 1 (ending 04/07/2017):

In this week, I explore various game engine greenfoot, unity and decided to use greenfoot as our developing platform. 

Next week, I am going to explore games implemented in greenfoot. 

# Courage (XP core value)

The project should small and simple to create and deploy.
As the first prototype should be easy and faster to develop, simplicity plays important role. Because of simplicity, we picked greenfoot as our developing platform for this project. Greenfoot has the smallest learning curve to pick up the language and the developing environment.
