# Week 2 (ending 04/14/2017):
  
In this week, I explored and  decided the game from greenfoot.

Next week, I plan to draw the class diagrams of the existing codes, and think about the features and design patterns that I may want to the original codes.

# Courage (XP core value)

In order to get our feet wet and start adding feature, our team needs to decide on the game we work on. Our main focues this week is to decide our start point. We exchange the examples we explore for the games developed in greenfoot and picked the one that we both are interested in. The communication is crucial and our researches serves as feedbacks.   

# Week 1 (ending 04/07/2017):

In this week, I explore various game engine greenfoot, unity and decided to use greenfoot as our developing platform. 

Next week, I am going to explore games implemented in greenfoot. 

# Simplicity (XP core value)

The project should small and simple to create and deploy.
As the first prototype should be easy and faster to develop, simplicity plays important role. Because of simplicity, we picked greenfoot as our developing platform for this project. Greenfoot has the smallest learning curve to pick up the language and the developing environment.
